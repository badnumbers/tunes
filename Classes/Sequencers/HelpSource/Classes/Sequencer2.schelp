TITLE:: Sequencer2
SUMMARY:: A new and experimental version of a sequencer for managing and playing patterns
CATEGORIES:: Streams-Patterns-Events

DESCRIPTION::
LINK::Classes/Sequencer2:: is intended to cut down the amount of boilerplate code required to sequence tracks. For example, it reduces the amount of keys that you need to specify when writing a pattern.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD::new
Creates an instance of LINK::Classes/Sequencer::.

INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD::addGlobalPreKeys
Adds a set of pattern keys which are added EMPHASIS::before:: a pattern. This is generally done to provide defaults which can be overridden in the patterns provided by LINK::#-addMidiPart:: and LINK::#-addScPart::.

ARGUMENT::keysArray
An even-numbered LINK::Classes/Array:: of keys and values. Each key (i.e. odd-numbered item) must be a LINK::Classes/Symbol::.

DISCUSSION::
CODE::
// All parts will use the Eâ™­ minor scale by default
~mysequencer.addGlobalPreKeys([
	\scale,Scale.minor,
	\ctranspose,3
]);
::

METHOD::addMidiPart
Adds a MIDI sequence to the specified section for the LINK::Classes/Synthesizer:: with the specified ID.

ARGUMENT::section
A LINK::Classes/Symbol:: representing the section of the piece.

ARGUMENT::synthId
A LINK::Classes/Symbol:: indicating the hardware synthesizer that the part is for.

NOTE::
This ID corresponds to the TELETYPE::Id:: property of a hardware synthesizer defined in the STRONG::configuration file::. See LINK::Classes/Config#*hardwareSynthesizers::.
::

ARGUMENT::pattern
A LINK::Classes/Pattern:: to play on the synthesizer. There is no need to specify the TELETYPE::\type::, TELETYPE::\midiout:: or TELETYPE::\chan:: keys since these are included automatically.

METHOD::addScPart
Adds a sequence to be played using a LINK::Classes/SynthDef::.

ARGUMENT::section
A LINK::Classes/Symbol:: representing the name of the LINK::Classes/SynthDef::.

ARGUMENT::synthDefName
A LINK::Classes/SynthDef:: that the part is for.

ARGUMENT::pattern
A LINK::Classes/Pattern:: to play on the LINK::Classes/SynthDef::. There is no need to specify the TELETYPE::\type::, TELETYPE::\midiout:: or TELETYPE::\chan:: keys since these are included automatically.

METHOD::addSynthesizerPostKeys
Adds a set of pattern keys which are added EMPHASIS::after:: every section for the specified LINK::Classes/Synthesizer::. These post-keys are generally patterns which use LINK::Classes/Pkey:: to access keys defined previously, for example by LINK::#-addMidiPart:: and LINK::#-addScPart::, and modify them in some way.

ARGUMENT::synthId
The ID of the LINK::Classes/Synthesizer:: that these post-keys will be applied to.

ARGUMENT::keysArray
An even-numbered LINK::Classes/Array:: of keys and values. Each key (i.e. odd-numbered item) must be a LINK::Classes/Symbol::.

DISCUSSION::
CODE::
// Add a little randomness to the \amp key for all notes generated for the REV2 synthesizer
~mysequencer.addSynthesizerPostKeys(~rev2, [
	\amp, (Pkey(\amp) * Pbrown(0.8,1.2,0.1)).clip(0,1)
]);
::

METHOD::play
Plays the specified sections by playing all of the parts in each section in parallel.

ARGUMENT::sections
An LINK::Classes/Array:: of LINK::Classes/Symbol::s denoting the sections to play.

METHOD::showGui
Opens a LINK::Classes/SequencerGui:: to provide a visual representation of the sequencers defined by this LINK::Classes/Sequencer::.

METHOD::stop
Stops playback.

EXAMPLES::

CODE::
(
~seq = Sequencer();
~seq.addMidiPart(\section1, \rev2, Pbind(
	\dur, 1,
	\pitch, Pseq([31,41,51,61]).trace
));
~seq.addMidiPart(\section2, \rev2, Pbind(
	\dur, 0.5,
	\pitch, Pseq([71,61,51,41,31]).trace
));
~seq.play([\section1,\section2]);
)

~seq.stop;
